# Frontend (Next.js):

# Approach

## Problem-Solving Strategy:

### User-Centric Design:
The application was built with simplicity and usability in mind, using modern design principles like atomic design for reusable components and responsive design with Tailwind CSS.

### Scalable Architecture:
The backend follows the modularized NestJS structure and implements the Repository Pattern for separation of concerns, making it maintainable and scalable.

### AI Integration:
Leveraged an external AI API to generate motivational messages based on user activity, providing personalized insights and improving user engagement.

### State Management:
Managed local state using React's useState for simplicity in the frontend, with efficient API integration to update the backend state.

## Key Features:
Habit CRUD operations with streak calculations.
AI-powered motivational messages.
Habit search and sorting.
Real-time UI updates with error handling.
Modularized frontend and backend for extensibility.
